# Quantum_repetition_code

This project demonstrates the implementation of the quantum repetition code using Qiskit, with a focus on error detection and correction under a noisy environment.The main objectives of our work are:

## ðŸ”¹ Objectives:
- Implement a 3-qubit repetition code.
- Simulate realistic quantum noise using depolarizing errors.
- Perform syndrome measurements to detect bit-flip errors.
- Construct a lookup table decoder based on statistical syndrome outcomes.
- Estimate the probability of incorrect decoding.
